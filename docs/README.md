# Standard OGN Receiver image

This project builds a RVSS standard OGN Receiver image for a Raspberry Pi. The image is based on SÃ©bastien Chaumontet's contribution to the OGN project. http://wiki.glidernet.org/downloads

Receivers running the RVSS standard OGN Receiver image:

 1. can be administered remotely (optional) by ssh via mail.rvss.ca provided you have a shell account on that server.
 1. keep OGN logs on the SD card in 1.5 GB of reserved space.
 1. optionally send the OGN logs to mail.rvss.ca for safekeeping.

## Known OGN Receiver names.

These receiver names are recognized. Fixed ports are used for autossh.

 * CPL3		6000
 * FALLFLD	6020
 * Fallfld3	6040
 * GlebeON	6060
 * PerthON	6080
 * TglwoodON	6100
 * WinghamON	6120

## Instructions.

4 GB SD card, minimum. Additional space will be ignored.

 1. Download zip file from mail.rvss.ca:/data/img/ognreceiver.img.zip
 1. Unzip
 1. Burn img to your SD card.
 1. Update OGN-receiver.conf. You can overwrite with one of these templates for convenience.

OGN-receiver.conf.cpl3  OGN-receiver.conf.GlebeON  OGN-receiver.conf.WinghamON

The template files are in the same directory as OGN-receiver.conf.

OGN-receiver.conf must have _wifiName, wifiPassword_ and _piUserPassword_ defined.

If you want ssh access from mail.rvss.ca, define _EnableCoreOGNTeamRemoteAdmin="true"_.

If you want logs to be copied to mail.rvss.ca, define _sendLogs="true"_.

## Stuff.

### Logs.

There is 1.5 GB of space for OGN log files. ATM, this is unmanaged; it could theoretically fill to capacity. If you are concerned about approaching the limit, login to your receiver and delete some files from /data/ogn/log/

OGN log file names are constructed from the name of your receiver and the UTC time at the start of logging.

### Access to your receiver.

If you defined _EnableCoreOGNTeamRemoteAdmin="true"_ and have a shell account on mail.rvss.ca...

 1. Login to mail.rvss.ca
 1. ssh pi@localhost -p PORT
 1. provide the password you specified for piUserPassword in OGN-receiver.conf.

You should know the port of your receiver.

### Timezone.

The receiver is set to use the Montreal timezone.

### Daily reboot.

The receiver will reboot at 5am daily. This will cause a new OGN log to be started. The reboot may resolve a remote connection issue.

### Pi Witty

If you want to install software for the Pi Witty hat, 

 1. pi@ogn-receiver:~ $ overlayctl disable
 1. pi@ogn-receiver:~ $ sudo reboot
 1. login again
 1. pi@ogn-receiver:~ $ cd ~
 1. pi@ogn-receiver:~ $ ./installWittyPi4

Remember to enable overlayctl once your software is setup.
